			<p>The start of the first semester was <b>very hard</b>. I completely forgot in middle school, that in schools you <b>have to learn</b>. I was shot. I started off very poorly, almost failed in everything, but in the last few weeks of the semester I got myself together and <b>pumped up my grades</b>. Well calculus still got me, but I didn't felt so bad, because I wasn't the only one.</p>

			<p>The second semester started off <b>more easier</b>. I already knew dear old Neptun and I had some luck with picking up courses. It was this semester when it all started to make sense. We had <b>2 projects</b> to make: a <b>website</b> for webdesigning, and a <b>game</b> for programming. I was legit <b>enjoying them</b>, and I think I maxed it out. I got 5 on programming and 4 on webdesign (<i>I was late and I tought it was -2 points/week... well it wasn't... it was -2 points/day</i>). Well, on operation systems I've gone IDGAF too hard in the beginning and than at the end of the semester I forgot to go to write the correcting exam, so yeah, it was gone. About operations research: I still hate all courses where you need to learn thousands of words making little to no sense perfectly.</p>
