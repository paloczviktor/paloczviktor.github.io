			<p>The start of the first semester was <b>very hard</b>. I completely forgot in middle school, that in schools you <b>have to learn</b>. I was shot. I started off very poorly, almost failed in everything, but in the last few weeks of the semester I got myself together and <b>pumped up my grades</b>. Well calculus still got me, but I didn't felt so bad, because I wasn't the only one.</p>

			<p>The second semester started off more easy. I already knew dear old Neptun and I had some luck with picking up courses. It was this semester when it all started to make sense. We had 2 projects to make: a website for webdesigning, and a game for programming.</p>
