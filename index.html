				Introduction
			</div>
			<p>Hello, my name is <b>Viktor</b>. I moved to Szeged 7 years old, when I started <b>primary school</b>. That was the first time I experienced programming, and I can tell, it was a blast. We used a smart little program called <b>Imagine Logo</b>. It gave me a basic understanding about some basics, loops and "kind of" UI elements. After that we used <b>FreePascal</b>. It was also enjoyable, but the thing is, at the time I tought about these programs like games, wich I'm accidentally good at.</p>
			<p>After these years I made a huge mistake. I went to a school focused on economycs. All of those 4 years from a programming perspective: gone to trash. The most complex thing we learned was MS Access databases, but IT lesson was generally boring. I realized fast that I really need to switch the topic if I want to learn further, than it all clicked. I remembered back a few years and I was like <b>"Daaamn, I need to go to university, and I need to learn what I liked back than!"</b></p>
			<p>I made my <b>final exam</b> fairly good and I got accepted to the uni. The real tale started here. I had a really rough beginning especially with mathematics. Calculus gave me a punch in the face, but I punched him back on second try. I'm now in my third semester and I really like it so far. I learned a lot, but still I'm just hitting the tip of the iceberg. <b>Greatness awaits.</b></p>
